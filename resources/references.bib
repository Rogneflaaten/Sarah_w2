	abstract = {Preheating with hot air at 85 – 125 °C was evaluated for its effectiveness in removing terpenes and terpenoids in softwood sawdust, thereby enhancing fungal preprocessing and subsequent saccharification of softwood-based mushroom substrates. Sawdust from pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) and spruce (Picea abies (L.) H. Karst.) was preheated prior to shiitake (Lentinula edodes (Berk.) Pegler) cultivation. Preheating removed up to 96 \% of terpenes in pine- based substrates and up to 50 \% in spruce-based substrates. Additionally, preheating decreased total terpenoids content in spruce by up to 78 \%. For the pine-based substrate, the mild heating generally led to faster colonisation and improved mushroom yield, with the fastest mycelia colonisation and highest yield observed for 105 °C treatment. This temperature was associated with the lowest content of total terpenes and absence of major monoterpenes. The content of terpenes and terpenoids continued to decrease during cultivation, alongside fungal degradation of lignocellulose. As a result of more extensive lignin degradation, the enzymatic digestibility of cellulose was higher for spruce-based spent mushroom substrate than for pine-based one (up to 89 \% vs. 49 \% conversion). Enzymatic digestibility showed a negative correlation with the α-pinene content, and a positive correlation with increasing preheating temperatures.},

	abstract = {Spent mushroom substrate (SMS), the main by-product of mushroom cultivation, is a source of sugars that can be released by saccharification. This work aimed at investigating the enzymatic saccharification of the polysaccharides of the SMS of shiitake (Lentinula edodes) and oyster mushroom (Pleurotus ostreatus) and exploring the lignin extraction from the saccharification residues. First, analytical enzymatic saccharification (AES) with a cellulase cocktail and an experimental hemicellulase-rich preparation was applied. AES revealed higher digestibility of both polysaccharides for shiitake SMS than for oyster mushroom SMS. Using the cellulase cocktail, shiitake SMS resulted in a digestibility above 80\% and 70\% (w/w) for cellulose and xylan, respectively, while the maximum values for oyster mushroom SMS were 52\% and 32\% (w/w). The experimental enzyme preparation resulted in lower cellulose digestibility and higher xylan digestibility. Still, the saccharification trend between the two SMS types remained unchanged. To enhance the enzymatic saccharification of oyster mushroom SMS, hydrothermal treatment was applied. The treatment improved the enzymatic digestibility of cellulose by up to 84\%. A validation experiment at larger scale showed that hydrothermally treated oyster mushroom SMS had a comparable overall conversion with non-treated shiitake SMS. Following a biorefinery strategy, lignin was extracted from the residues of the preparative enzymatic saccharification using the green solvent γ-valerolactone under different temperatures and holding times. The extracted product contained 98.8\% lignin and did not contain cellulose or xylan. The results of this study provide the grounds for biorefinery processes enabling recovery of bioactive compounds, fermentable sugars, and high-quality lignin from SMS},

	abstract = {This study aimed to assess subcritical water extraction (SWE) and pressurized ethanol extraction (PEE) for recovering bioactive compounds from spent mushroom substrate (SMS) derived from shiitake and oyster mushrooms. The extraction of bioactive compounds can facilitate the valorisation of SMS, an increasingly important waste stream whose management and disposal pose challenges for both mushroom producers and the environment. A 32 experimental design, using three temperatures (125, 150, and 175 °C) and three holding times (0, 15, and 30 min) was used in SWE. PEE was run at a single temperature (175 °C) and two holding times (0 and 15 min). The experimental results revealed that the highest extraction yield was achieved in shiitake SMS using SWE at 175 °C and 15 min. In most SWE conditions, shiitake SMS yielded higher concentrations of total phenolic compounds, total carbohydrates, and β-glucans compared to oyster mushroom SMS. Ascorbic acid, vanillic acid, protocatechuic acid, and gallic acid were the most abundant phenolic acids identified in both extracts. The SWE extracts of shiitake SMS exhibited higher DPPH and FRAP antioxidant activity than those of oyster mushroom SMS, and this activity increased with increasing temperature and time. PEE extracts exhibited higher DPPH and TEAC antioxidant activity for oyster mushroom SMS compared to shiitake SMS and showed a negative trend with increasing extraction time at 175 °C for both SMS. Our results show that SWE and PEE are viable methods for extracting bioactive compounds from SMS.},
